# Alzheimer-Brain-Tumor-Detection-System
 ∗ Developed a deep learning system to classify brain tumors (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, No Tumor) and  detect Alzheimer’s stages (Mild, Moderate, Very Mild, No Dementia) using MRI scan images.  ∗ Integrated the models into a Flask web application, allowing users to upload MRI images and receive instant  predictions.
